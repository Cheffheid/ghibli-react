This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Its purpose is to get some React practice in, and get me more comfortable with using ES6 syntax.

Eventually I may also try adding CSS Grids for layout and see if we can get something good going with that too.

The API documentation can be found here: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/. It doesn't require authentication right now, so it's perfect for this sort of practice.
